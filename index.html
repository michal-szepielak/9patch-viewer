            Once you call it in, the people who show up with be with the office
            of medical investigations. it's primarily who you'll talk to. Police

            they're having. Typically ODs are not a high priority call. There's
            nothing here to incriminate you, so I'd be amazed if you got placed
            under arrest. However, if you do, you say nothing. You tell them you
            just want your lawyer. And you call Saul Goodman.
